   <p>The comedy television show Friends, which aired in the 1990s and was set in Manhattan, is about six friends who share every life experience; love, marriage, divorce, children, heartbreak, fights, new jobs and job losses, and a wide range of drama are all included.</p>

<div class="col-9">
  <h3 >MONICA</h3>
   <p>hyperactive, energizing, and persistent. As the group's "mother," she can be pushy and controlling, just way some mothers are. She can also be a realistic, level-headed friend who supports people during their irrational moments. Monica is devoted and thoughtful.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-9">
  <h3 align="right">ROSS</h3>
   <p>Ross exhibits the traits of the archetypal "loser geek," being clumsy, overly sensitive, and socially awkward despite being intellectually competent and occasionally being polite, loving, thoughtful, and kind. UNAGI! </p>

  <h3>CHANDLER </h3>
   <p>Although he gets slightly in trouble with his comments, his quick wit and humor make him entertaining to be around. He frequently makes fun of his buddies and is fairly forthright with his snappy, snarky remarks. He always seems to be working on some strange ideas. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-9">
  <h3 align="right">RACHEL</h3>
   <p>She is versatile and doesn't hesitate adjusting her plans at the last minute if she feels like it. Rachel is spontaneous and trusts her heart instead of her mind when making choices. </p>

<div class="col-9">
  <h3>JOEY</h3>
   <p>Joey is depicted as being promiscuous, naive, but good-natured. He is likewise shown to be tremendously devoted to, protective of, and loyal to his pals. He is a womanizer who enjoys eating and has greater success finding dates than the other members of the group. He has a distinct infantile side as well, which contrasts with his image as the "ladies' guy."</p></div>
 

<div class="col-9">
  <h3 align="right">PHOEBE</h3>
   <p>Phoebe is a charming but odd guitarist. Phoebe is, in some ways, still a child at heart despite having had nothing like a normal, complete childhood. She is often very naive, sometimes smart. Joey told her that Santa Claus didn't exist, but she still thought he did. </p>
